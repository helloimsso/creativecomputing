        How has web design reflected out culture?<br>
        <br>

        Global companies, such as Mc Donald’s shows different design styles to reach variety of people.<br> Designs are the most crucial communication tool for use in different cultures.<br> I assume that the most common tool is websites. <br>Over the last two decades, the number of Internet users has grown rapidly and the web<br> has become a significant and indispensable communication thing throughout the world. I think culture is <br>one of the most important phenomena that we can’t ignore in design and development of digital <br>products. Because these are reflected in users’ website preferences as well. Chinese, Japanese and Korean<br> users often expect to see a greater use of images, videos and sidebars, On the other hand,<br> Scandinavian or German designs tend to be more text-heavy. Actually, McDonald’s website is a perfect<br> example for cross-cultural website design. McDonald's websites show different countries' web styles and<br> designs according to their culture. In addition to text, it includes the type of image used, the<br> selected printing technique, color palette design, and selected layout.<br>
        Patterns of culture in the design can be identified as reflections of emotions, behaviors, and the<br> beliefs of users in different cultures.<br>
