<br>Journey: observation<br>

The journey from my house to Bryant Park is very special place to me. At least twice a week I go to Bryant Park, is the closest park near my house, to take a break. Since I live around Times Square, every day I hear very loud noises, a number of people passing by include tourists, bright lights and neon signs, and awful smells on the street. Personally I really like the city, but sometimes I want to get away from the siren sounds and people. So the place I found was the park, which serves as a refuge. Even though Bryant Park is well known park and crowded, I really like to see the panoramic landscapes that formed by high rise buildings. At the park I take a rest and enjoy seeing the trees and hearing the chirping birds sound. When I go there, I feel like I am in nature. This place brings me the comfort and makes me relax, so this is an important place to recharge and heal. The journey on the map looks like the mirror on image of an “L”. The distance from my house is really close so I walk to get there. By walking on the street, I have to pass by the 40th street terminal and Times Square area, which are really crowded every day. I also hate when people block my way. Particularly, when I feel down and busy. So, I usually go to 7th and 6th avenue which are quieter and not crowded compared to the street. There are many fabric stores on the 37th street 7 avenue, so sometimes clothes hangers occupy the space. Not only that, some people often sell the vintage clothing in the street. It is also easy to see people smoking on the sidewalk and the smoke spread widely and disappears. There is a lot of garbage bags on the street and it doesn’t give a pleasant feeling. However, the good smell of food trucks and restaurants tempt me to forget about the stinky smells on the street for a while. There are street performers, musicians, and artists so I can listen to good music while I walking down the street and see various works of art. There are many office buildings near the park, so many office workers are passing the street quickly. During lunchtime at the park, many people are sitting in there and having lunch. There are several food stores in the park so many people use them and I am the one of them. In Bryant Park, there is a waffle store that I love. So when I go to the park, I get a waffle and find a space to sit and then have fun with my sister. In front of the park there is an iconic water fountain, which is huge and makes me feel peaceful. I see people are busily coming and going on the street, but when I’m in the park it seems like my time is pausing for a moment.
