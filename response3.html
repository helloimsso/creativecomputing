	<br>Since <strong>Google</strong> change the typeface from <strong>serif</strong> to <strong>san-serif</strong>. Do you think new san-serif logo is smarter or hipper than before? San-serif typeface can <strong>represent</strong> new era of typeface design?<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	Serif typeface is old style typefaces.They are used in everything from book publishing to newspapers and magazines.The mood and feelings most associated with serif typeface is classic, elegant, and formal.On the other hand,
	Sans serif typeface is considered more modern and include a variety of widths and shapes.The mood and feelings most associated with sans serif typeface is modern, friendly, direct, clean and minimal. 
	I personally think that Sans-serif is the most widely used of all typeface. The reason is because today it is commonly used for print as well as for display. So it is strongly influential typeface that represent new era of typeface design.
