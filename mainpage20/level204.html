        <li>Evening blooms in heat a braying of bells
        from August Town; my mind fizzles
        over “A Grammarian’s Funeral,” its sporadic arc
        welding and breaking the question, how to</li>
        align poetry with truth. A stalled elevation,
        returning in my old professor’s blight
        <li>marginalia, his book, offered abruptly,
        taken, stowed away, now posthumously examined:
        fragile pencil webbings of flickered exclamations,
        impatient the way he paced the blackboard,
        erased a word (“meteors”), hurled glances

        He died. His pupil flowered later into
        the voltage of self-alienating poetry,
        away from that moribund grammarian’s</li>
        <li>blind reluctance. Still, as moving iron
        will fuse and repel, by his book, I am
        the unspared prodigal of his abuse.</li></ol></div>
