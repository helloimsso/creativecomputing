	<p5><br>Evening blooms in heat a braying of bells
        <br>from August Town; my mind fizzles
        <br>over “A Grammarian’s Funeral,” its sporadic arc
        <br>welding and breaking the question, how to
        <br>align poetry with truth. A stalled elevation,
        <br>returning in my old professor’s blight
        <br>marginalia, his book, offered abruptly,
        <br>taken, stowed away, now posthumously examined:
        <br>fragile pencil webbings of flickered exclamations,
        <br>impatient the way he paced the blackboard,
        <br>erased a word (“meteors”), hurled glances
        <br>somewhere far off, beyond me, himself
        <br>
        <br>a boy-comet, weeping to his duty.
        <br>Once I strayed to the tubular steel chair
        <br>chained in a corner, glistening sweat
        <br>on one leg, our eyes wounded appraisal
        <br>met there and he cracked the air, charged
        <br>me pick up Browning’s chorus. I couldn’t.
        <br>He died. His pupil flowered later into
        <br>the voltage of self-alienating poetry,
        <br>away from that moribund grammarian’s
        <br>blind reluctance. Still, as moving iron
        <br>will fuse and repel, by his book, I am
        <br>the unspared prodigal of his abuse.</p5>
