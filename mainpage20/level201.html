	Evening blooms in heat a braying of bells
        from August Town; my mind fizzles
        over <strong>“A Grammarian’s Funeral,”</strong> its sporadic arc
        welding and breaking the question, how to
        align poetry with truth. A stalled elevation,
        returning in my old professor’s blight
         <strong>marginalia</strong>, his book, offered abruptly,
        taken, stowed away, now posthumously examined:
        <strong>fragile</strong> pencil webbings of flickered exclamations,
         <strong>impatient</strong> the way he paced the blackboard,
        erased a word “meteors”), hurled glances
        somewhere far off, beyond me, himself
        a boy-comet, weeping to his duty.
        Once I strayed to the tubular steel chair
        chained in a corner, glistening  <strong>sweat</strong>
        on one leg, our eyes wounded appraisal
        met there and he cracked the air, charged
        me pick up Browning’s chorus. I couldn’t.
        He died. His pupil flowered later into
        the voltage of self-alienating poetry,
        away from that moribund grammarian’s
        blind reluctance.  <strong>Still</strong>, as moving iron
        will fuse and repel, by his book, I am
        the unspared prodigal of his abuse.
