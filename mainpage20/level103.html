        <p4>
        <br>
        Evening blooms in heat a braying of bells
        from August Town; my mind fizzles
        over “A Grammarian’s Funeral,” its sporadic arc
        welding and breaking the question, how to<br>
        align poetry with truth. A stalled elevation,
        returning in my old professor’s blight
        marginalia, his book, offered abruptly,
        taken, stowed away, now posthumously examined:<br>
        fragile pencil webbings of flickered exclamations,
        impatient the way he paced the blackboard,
        erased a word (“meteors”), hurled glances
        somewhere far off, beyond me, himself<br>
        a boy-comet, weeping to his duty.
        Once I strayed to the tubular steel chair
        chained in a corner, glistening sweat
        on one leg, our eyes wounded appraisal<br>
        met there and he cracked the air, charged
        me pick up Browning’s chorus. I couldn’t.
        He died. His pupil flowered later into
        the voltage of self-alienating poetry,<br>
        away from that moribund grammarian’s
        blind reluctance. Still, as moving iron
        will fuse and repel, by his book, I am
        the unspared prodigal of his abuse.<br></p4>
