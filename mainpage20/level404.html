	<br>Evening blooms in heat a braying of bells
        from August Town; my mind fizzles</br>
        <br>over “A Grammarian’s Funeral,” its sporadic arc
        welding and breaking the question, how to</br>
        <br>align poetry with truth. A stalled elevation,
        returning in my old professor’s blight</br>
        <br>marginalia, his book, offered abruptly,
        taken, stowed away, now posthumously examined:</br>
        <br>fragile pencil webbings of flickered exclamations,
        impatient the way he paced the blackboard,</br>
        <br>erased a word (“meteors”), hurled glances
        somewhere far off, beyond me, himself</br>
        <br>a boy-comet, weeping to his duty.
        Once I strayed to the tubular steel chair</br>
        <br>chained in a corner, glistening sweat
        on one leg, our eyes wounded appraisal</br>
        <br>met there and he cracked the air, charged
        me pick up Browning’s chorus. I couldn’t.</br>
        <br>He died. His pupil flowered later into
        the voltage of self-alienating poetry,</br>
        <br>away from that moribund grammarian’s
        blind reluctance. Still, as moving iron</br>
        <br>will fuse and repel, by his book, I am
        the unspared prodigal of his abuse.</br> </p>
