	<br>Evening blooms in heat a braying of bells<br>
        <br>from August Town; my mind fizzles<br>
        <br>over “A Grammarian’s Funeral,” its sporadic arc<br>
        <br>welding and breaking the question, how to<br>
        <br>align poetry with truth. A stalled elevation,<br>
        <br>returning in my old professor’s blight<br>
        <br>marginalia, his book, offered abruptly,<br>
        <br>taken, stowed away, now posthumously examined:<br>
        <br>fragile pencil webbings of flickered exclamations,<br>
        <br>impatient the way he paced the blackboard,<br>
        <br>erased a word (“meteors”), hurled glances<br>
        <br>somewhere far off, beyond me, himself<br>
        <br><br>
        <br>a boy-comet, weeping to his duty.<br>
        <br>Once I strayed to the tubular steel chair<br>
        <br>chained in a corner, glistening sweat<br>
        <br>on one leg, our eyes wounded appraisal<br>
        <br>met there and he cracked the air, charged<br>
        <br>me pick up Browning’s chorus. I couldn’t.<br>
        <br>He died. His pupil flowered later into<br>
        <br>the voltage of self-alienating poetry,<br>
        <br>away from that moribund grammarian’s<br>
        <br>blind reluctance. Still, as moving iron<br>
        <br>will fuse and repel, by his book, I am<br>
        <br>the unspared prodigal of his abuse.<br>
