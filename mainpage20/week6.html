        <p1>
        <br>Evening blooms in heat a braying of bells</br>
        <br>from August Town; my mind fizzles</br>
        <br>over “A Grammarian’s Funeral,” its sporadic arc</br>
        <br>welding and breaking the question, how to</br>
        <br>align poetry with truth. A stalled elevation,</br>
        <br>returning in my old professor’s blight</br>
        <br>marginalia, his book, offered abruptly,</br>
        <br>taken, stowed away, now posthumously examined:</br>
        <br>fragile pencil webbings of flickered exclamations,</br>
        <br>impatient the way he paced the blackboard,</br>
        <br>erased a word (“meteors”), hurled glances</br>
        <br>somewhere far off, beyond me, himself </br>
        <br>a boy-comet, weeping to his duty.</br>
        <br>Once I strayed to the tubular steel chair</br>
        <br>chained in a corner, glistening sweat</br>
        <br>on one leg, our eyes wounded appraisal</br>
        <br>met there and he cracked the air, charged</br>
        <br>me pick up Browning’s chorus. I couldn’t.</br>
        <br>He died. His pupil flowered later into</br>
        <br>the voltage of self-alienating poetry,</br>
        <br>away from that moribund grammarian’s</br>
        <br>blind reluctance. Still, as moving iron</br>
        <br>will fuse and repel, by his book, I am</br>
        <br>the unspared prodigal of his abuse.</br> </p1>
