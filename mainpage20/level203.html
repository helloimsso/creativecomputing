	<span><a>Evening blooms in heat<br> a braying of bells</span>
        from August Town;<br> my mind fizzles
        over “A Grammarian’s<br> Funeral,” its sporadic arc
        welding and breaking <br>the question, how to
        align <em><strong>poetry</strong></em> with truth.<br> A stalled elevation,
        returning in my old <br>professor’s blight
        marginalia, his <em><strong>book</strong></em>, <br>offered abruptly,
        taken, stowed away, now <br>posthumously examined:
        fragile pencil webbings of<br> flickered exclamations,
        impatient the way he paced<br> the <em><strong>blackboard</strong></em>,
        erased a word (“meteors”),<br> hurled glances
        <span>somewhere</span> far off, beyond<br> me, himself
        a boy-comet, weeping to<br> his duty.
        Once I strayed to the <br>tubular steel chair
        chained in a corner, <br>glistening sweat
        on one leg, our eyes <br>wounded appraisal
        met there and he cracked <br>the air, charged
        me pick up Browning’s chorus.<br> I couldn’t.
        He died. His pupil flowered <br>later into
        the voltage of , <em><strong>self-alienating</strong></em><br> poetry,
        away from that moribund <br>grammarian’s
        blind reluctance. Still,<br> as moving iron
        will fuse and repel, by <br>his book, I am
        <span>the unspared <em><strong>prodigal</strong></em> of<br> his abuse.</a></span>
